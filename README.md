# Security-Assessment

Security assessment ka matlab hai systems aur networks ko test karna to find weaknesses. Yeh 5 major types hotay hain:

### VC (Vulnerability Scanning)

**English:** Automated scan to detect known vulnerabilities in systems.

**Urdu:** Automated tools (jaise Nessus, OpenVAS) use karke known vulnerabilities check ki jati hain.

### PT (Penetration Testing)

**English:** Ethical hacking to simulate real-world attacks.

**Urdu:** Hackers ki tarah system ko test karna to find exploitable weaknesses.

### RS (Risk Scanning / Risk Assessment)

**English:** Identify and analyze risks that can impact business operations.

**Urdu:** Risk identify karna aur unka impact measure karna.

### CR (Compliance Review)

**English:** Check whether policies, standards, and regulations are being followed.

**Urdu:** Dekhna ke organization compliance rules (ISO, GDPR, HIPAA) follow kar rahi hai ya nahi.

### PR (Privacy Review)

**English:** Assessment of how personal data is collected, stored, and protected.

**Urdu:** Privacy policies aur data handling check karna ke sahi tariqe se implement ho rahe hain ya nahi.

## Audit and Assurance (IA, EA, CA, OA, FA)

Audit ka main purpose hota hai independent check to verify compliance, accuracy, and effectiveness.

### Types of Audits:

#### IA (Internal Audit)

**English:** Performed by organization’s own audit team.

**Urdu:** Company ke andar ki team apni processes check karti hai.

#### EA (External Audit)

Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA) of systems

Compliance with laws & standards

Financial accuracy

###  Audit Examination Options

**English:**
When auditors examine, they use different approaches:

Interviews (staff se poochna)

Observation (process ko dekhna)

Documentation Review (policies, logs check karna)

Testing (controls aur system directly test karna)

Sampling (poore data ki bajaye sirf ek sample verify karna)

**Urdu:**
Audit me poore data check nahi hota, balki different methods use hote hain jese interview, observation, document review aur sampling.

### Audit Frameworks

Common frameworks jo auditors follow karte hain:

COBIT (Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology)

ISO/IEC 27001 (Information Security Management)

NIST Cybersecurity Framework

ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library)

SSAE 18 / SOC reports

 **Urdu:**
Audit ke liye frameworks ek guideline provide karte hain jisme standard controls aur checks defined hote hain.

## SSAV Version

SSAV = Security Self-Assessment and Validation

Yeh ek process hota hai jisme organization khud apne systems ki self-assessment karti hai aur phir usko validate karti hai with audits.

Different versions aate hain updated standards ke hisaab se (like PCI DSS v4.0, ISO 27001:2022).

**Urdu:**
SSAV ka matlab hai khud apna system audit karna aur phir validate karna against updated compliance versions.

### Sampling in Audit

**English:**
Sampling means selecting a small portion of data or transactions to review instead of checking everything. This saves time and resources while still giving accurate results.

**Urdu:**
Sampling ka matlab hai ke auditor poora data check nahi karta, balki ek chhota sample select karke uska review karta hai taake overall compliance ka idea mil jaye.

## Summary

Examination ke options hote hain interview, observation, document review aur sampling. Frameworks me COBIT, ISO 27001 aur NIST aate hain. SSAV self-assessment aur validation ka process hai.
